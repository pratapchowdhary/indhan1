- [x] Verified: production build now completes successfully (369 entries precached, sw.js generated)

## Diesel Stock Display Bugs (Both Pages)
- [x] Fix: Inventory page Diesel currentStock = 0 — syncFuelStockFromLatestReport now runs on server startup (server/_core/index.ts) AND after each reconciliation save
- [x] Fix: Dashboard Fuel Intelligence Diesel stock = 0% — falls back to products.currentStock when no dip readings exist (db-fuel-intelligence.ts)
- [x] Fix: Directly updated products.currentStock for Diesel to 6823.32 L and Petrol to 11920.19 L in DB

## Diesel Stock Correction — FY 2025-26
- [x] Correct Diesel (HSD) currentStock to 13,146.20 L (confirmed by Kranthi from BEES register)
- [x] Root cause: closingStockDiesel on 31 Mar 2026 was a data entry error in Excel (6,823.32 recorded vs correct 13,146.20 = opening 15,677.09 − sold 2,530.89)
- [x] Fixed: both products.currentStock and daily_reports.closingStockDiesel for 31 Mar 2026 updated to 13,146.20 L

## Stock Consistency Validation
- [ ] Backend: tRPC procedure stockValidation.getInconsistencies — query daily_reports for rows where ABS(opening - sold - closing) > tolerance (5L)
- [ ] Backend: returns list of flagged rows with date, fuel type, opening, sold, closing, expected closing, variance

## Implied Receipts Diesel Fix
- [x] Fix: Implied Receipts (Diesel) now uses period-boundary formula (Closing_last − Opening_first + Total Sales) = 9,46,000 L ✅
  Root cause: row-by-row sum was inflated by data entry errors in daily closing stock values

## Manual Dip Reading Feature
- [x] Schema: dip_readings table confirmed (date, fuelType, dipLitres, tankId, readingTime, recordedBy, notes)

- [x] Backend: Excel import router updated to read Dip and Manual Dip Reading columns from Daily Stock Statement sheet
- [x] Backend: importRouter now auto-imports dip readings when Excel file contains Daily Stock Statement sheet
- [x] Frontend: DailyStockStatement — DipCell shows saved value (amber) or "Enter dip" (italic) per row, click to edit
- [x] Frontend: DailyStockStatement — Dip Var column shows coloured VarianceBadge (green/red/blue) when dip reading exists
- [x] Frontend: DailyStockStatement — saving a dip reading invalidates query and refetches immediately
- [x] Frontend: DailyStockStatement — "No Dip Readings" banner now explains both manual entry and bulk Excel import options
- [x] Frontend: DailyStockStatement — live variance preview while typing uses Closing Stock − typed value
- [x] Inventory: Dip section confirmed to pull from same dip_readings table via getDipReadings procedure

## Daily Stock Register — Simulated Dip Readings

- [ ] Frontend: DipCell shows "sim" badge (orange) when dip is simulated, amber value when real
- [ ] Frontend: VarianceBadge shows variance for all rows (simulated and real)
- [ ] Frontend: Clicking "Enter dip" on a simulated row opens inline input to enter real reading
- [ ] Frontend: Real entry overrides simulated value and removes sim badge

## Daily Stock Register — Dip Import Fix (Excel Column Mapping)
- [x] Schema: dip_stick_reading column added to dip_readings table (migration applied)
- [x] Import: fixed range:2 to skip rows 1-2 (empty + merged header), uses row 3 as column header row
- [x] Import: reads "Dip" (col E) as raw stick number for Petrol; "Manual Dip Reading" (col F) as litres
- [x] Import: reads "Dip_1"/"Dip.1" for Diesel stick; "Manual Dip Reading_1"/"Manual Dip Reading.1" for Diesel litres
- [x] Backend: upsertDipReading stores dipStickReading alongside dipLitres
- [x] Backend: getDailyStockStatement returns dipStickReading per row for both fuel types
- [x] Backend: saveDipReading tRPC procedure accepts dipStickReading optional field
- [x] Frontend: DipCell shows stick number (small grey) + litres (amber) when data exists
- [x] Frontend: DipCell edit mode has two inputs — Stick and Litres

- [x] Inventory: Removed unused imports (TrendingDown, TrendingUp, Minus, Save, Pencil, History, fmtL)
- [x] Daily Stock Register: Confirmed as the single authoritative place for dip entry and variance

## Daily Stock Register — Dip Backfill
- [x] Checked daily_reports table — no dip columns exist (dip data was never imported)
- [x] Import router already updated to read Dip and Manual Dip Reading columns from Daily Stock Statement sheet
- [x] Added "Upload BEES Excel File" button directly on Daily Stock page (no-dip banner) — triggers inline import
- [x] DipCell inline entry confirmed working: click amber cell, enter Stick + Litres, press Enter or save icon
- [x] DipCell saves via fuelIntelligence.saveDipReading mutation and invalidates dailyStockStatement query
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors confirmed
