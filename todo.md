- [x] Fix 4: getDashboardKPIs receivables queries wrong table — fix to use customer_payments
- [x] Fix 5: Verify app loads cleanly with real data after all fixes

## Phase 2 Date Filter Fixes

## Critical Bug Fix — RangeError: Invalid time value (Production Crash)
- [x] Root cause identified: TiDB Cloud returns varchar date columns as full ISO timestamps (e.g. "2026-03-31T04:00:00.000Z") not plain "YYYY-MM-DD" strings

## Performance & Security Audit

- [x] All pages: Filter state is local per page (no cross-page persistence needed)

## Dashboard Date Display Fix

- [x] Added amber badge "Data: Apr 2025 – Mar 2026" to make data currency visible
- [x] Period buttons updated: "31 Mar" / "7 Days" / "MTD" / "FY 25-26" — all reference data period

- [x] Fallback chart uses data period dates, not system clock

## Dashboard Custom Date Range Picker
- [x] Added "Custom" button alongside Today/7 Days/MTD/FY 25-26
- [x] When "Custom" is active, From/To date inputs appear (min: 2025-04-01, max: 2026-03-31)
- [x] Apply button triggers KPI and chart data refresh for the custom range
- [x] Chart title updates to show the selected custom range dates
- [x] KPI sub-label updates to show the custom range (e.g. "2025-06-01 – 2025-08-31")

## Data Integrity Audit & Dashboard Expenses KPI
- [x] Audit Net Profit: root cause found — daily_reports.netProfit only deducts same-day expenses, not full operating expenses ledger
- [x] Verified: True Net Profit = grossProfit − expenses_table = ₹21,74,677.21 vs Excel ₹21,74,293.67 (₹383 rounding diff)
- [x] Fixed getDashboardKPIs: now queries expenses table for totalExpenses and computes netProfit = grossProfit − totalExpenses
- [x] Fixed cashBalance: now uses last day's closing balance (subquery) instead of SUM of all days
- [x] Added Expenses KPI card to Dashboard (5-card grid: Sales / Gross Profit / Expenses / Net Profit / Outstanding)
- [x] Net Profit sub-label shows formula: "Margin: X% • Gross − Expenses"

## Dashboard Chart Type Fixes
- [x] Replace Expenses bar section with donut/pie chart showing breakdown by category (subHeadAccount)
- [x] Add getExpenseBreakdown endpoint returning category totals for selected date range
- [x] Sales vs Expenses trend: keep as AreaChart (correct — shows time-series trend)
- [x] Sales Mix replaced with Expenses by Category donut (real data, responds to date filter)

- [x] KPI cards: Total Sales, Petrol Volume, Diesel Volume, Gross Profit
- [x] Payment method cards: Cash / Card / Credit / Online with amounts
- [x] Bar chart: daily Petrol vs Diesel volume (correct chart type for time-series)
- [x] Payment Mix donut: Cash/Card/Credit/Online % breakdown
- [x] Table: daily sales register with date, volumes, total sales, payment splits, status
- [x] Period presets: Mar 2026 / Feb 2026 / Jan 2026 / Q4 FY26 / FY 25-26 / Custom
